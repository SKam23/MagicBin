# CMU 2022 Build18 Hackathon: MagicBin
### By [Alex Yoon('25)](https://github.com/alexyoon26), [Minjune Song('25)](https://github.com/pythonlearner1025/magicbin),[Steven Kam('25)](https://github.com/SKam23),  [Sajan Shah('25)](https://github.com/sajshah6), [Luke Blackwell('25)](https://github.com/Xeno852)

The MagicBin is an enhanced trash detetection system that hopes to collectly solve the inherent recycling problem that faces our landfills. The system blends machine learning and open source softare together with the Raspberry Pi ecosystem. Our object detection software combines OpenCV and MobileNet dataset to effectively differentiate recyleble bottles from other landfill waste. Our dataset combines over 10,000 images to effectively communicate our output along with the object's desired recyclability. Our hardware system, which includes Raspberry Pi, HD PiCam, Arduino MKR ZERO combined with two high-torque servos, can efficiently recognize the output and direct the item to its proper place in our trash bin. Furthermore, our implementation of a lottery-based system using smart contracts encourage users of the MagicBin to recycle on their own, while also rewarding them for their current and future contribution to the MagicBin.

## Purpose 
Our main purpose is to improve the accuracy of recycling and increase recycling amounts through monetary incentives.

## Next Step
With an increased budget and additional time, our MagicBin would consist of a newer and improved trained dataset that can detect recyclables beyond bottles. With a larger dataset, our hope is to differentiate multiple recycable materials from other waste products. This would allow our MagicBin to consist of multiple compartments for each identifiable category of recyclable materials. Furthemore, with a higher quality hardware system, our MagicBin could more quickly and efficiently sort our trash with respect to its recyclability.

Currently, the national recycling rate sits at only 32.1%, but nearly 80% of all waste can be recycled. Our MagicBin hopes to solve this systemic problem by providing a convenience to users. By allowing our trash bin to determine the recyclability of the object, users are now free of the burden to identify their waste products on their own. Furthermore, by seperating recyclable items from each other, our MagicBin can reduce potential contamination among some plastics and non-recyable materials. Overall, by adding more compartments and improving our hardware features, our MagicBin hopes to increase the recycling rate by reducing contamination and improving recycling identification.
