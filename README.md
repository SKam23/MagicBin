# CMU 21-22 Build18 Hackathon : MagicBin
### By Alex Yoon, Luke Blackwell, Minjune Song, Sajan Shah, Steven Kam

The MagicBin is an enhanced trash detetection system that hopes to collectly solve the inherent recycling problem that faces our landfills. The system blends machine learning and open source softare together with the Raspberry Pi ecosystem. Our object detection software combines OpenCV and MobileNet dataset to effectively differentiate recyleble bottles from other landfill waste. Our dataset combines over 10,000 images to effectively communicate our output along with the object's desired recyclability. Our hardware system, which includes Raspberry Pi, CannaKit, and multiple Raspberry Pi servos, can efficiently recognize the output and direct the item to its proper place in our trash bin. Furthermore, our implementation of a lottery-based system using smart contracts encourage users of the MagicBin to recycle on their own, while also reawrding them for their current contribution to the MagicBin.
